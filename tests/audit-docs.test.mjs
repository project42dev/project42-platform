// The documentation audit is a CI gate, so it needs the same treatment as any
// other gate: proof that it catches each class of defect, and proof that it
// does not fire on the things that are correct as written. A gate that cannot
// fail is not a gate, and a gate that cries wolf gets disabled.
//
// Every case runs against a throwaway fixture repository rather than against
// this repository, so a real documentation fix cannot silently break a test and
// a real documentation defect cannot silently make one pass.
