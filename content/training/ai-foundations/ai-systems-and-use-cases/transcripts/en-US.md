## Welcome: Welcome And Outcomes

Welcome. This class is about choosing useful AI work without treating a model as magic. We will separate the model from the complete system around it, match capability patterns to appropriate tasks, distinguish assistance from automation, and decide where human review must remain. You do not need to know how to train a model. You do need to ask disciplined questions about the outcome, the information used, the actions allowed, the people affected, and what happens when the result is wrong. Those questions work across providers, products, and model families.

## Narration: Complete System Explanation

Artificial intelligence is a broad label for computer systems that perform tasks associated with perception, prediction, language, planning, or decision support. Machine learning is one way to produce that behavior by learning patterns from examples rather than programming every rule. A model is the learned component that transforms inputs into outputs, but a product is never only the model. The complete system also includes instructions, input data, retrieval, software, tools, permissions, user experience, monitoring, and people who own the result. NIST frames AI risk management around products, services, systems, organizations, and affected people, not around an isolated response. That wider view changes evaluation. Ask what information enters, which component supplies it, what the model may propose, what tools may act, which controls limit those actions, how outcomes are measured, and who responds to failure. A fluent answer is one observable output from that system. It does not prove that the input was trustworthy, that a tool succeeded, or that the workflow is safe.

## Demonstration: System Boundary Demonstration

Consider a meeting-summary assistant. In the first design, a person pastes approved notes, the model drafts a summary, and the person edits it before sharing. In the second design, software records every meeting, identifies participants, stores transcripts, drafts decisions, sends messages, and updates a project system automatically. Both may use the same language model, yet they are not the same use case. The second system collects more sensitive data, has more integrations, can affect more people, and can act before a person reviews each output. Its evaluation must include recording consent, access control, retention, participant identification, tool authorization, error recovery, and the correctness of each external update. This comparison shows why model capability is only one row in a system decision. Changing the model does not remove the need to control data or recover from a mistaken action.

## Narration: Capability Patterns Explanation

A useful starting point is to name the capability pattern before naming a product. Generative systems can draft, summarize, explain, transform formats, extract structure, classify examples, brainstorm alternatives, or reason over material supplied in context. Other AI systems may rank, recommend, forecast, detect patterns, transcribe audio, interpret images, or control a physical process. The label AI does not tell you which capability is present, which evidence it uses, or how reliable it is for your case. Match the pattern to a measurable outcome. If the outcome is a shorter policy summary, define which policy version is authoritative, which facts must remain, who reviews the draft, and how omissions are detected. If the outcome is classifying support requests, define the categories, representative test cases, unacceptable errors, escalation path, and what happens to uncertain cases. Good candidates have suitable data, observable quality, bounded consequences, and controls that match those consequences. A visually impressive demo without a defined outcome is not yet a use case.

## Learner Prompt: Capability Fit Prompt

Choose one task you know well. State the desired outcome in one sentence, then name the capability pattern you would test. Add one piece of trustworthy input and one observable quality signal. Avoid naming a provider until those four items are clear. Pause the class while you write.

Expected learner action: Write a specific outcome, one matching capability pattern, one trustworthy input, and one measurable quality signal.

## Pause: Capability Fit Work Time

## Narration: Assistance Automation Explanation

Next, separate assistance from automation. An assistant proposes work for a person to inspect. An automated system may act without a person reviewing every output. The difference is authority, not vocabulary. A model drafting three private alternatives is assistance when the learner chooses whether to use any of them. The same model becomes part of automation when software sends one alternative to customers, changes a record, deploys code, or controls equipment. As authority increases, evaluation must expand beyond answer quality. Test permissions, tool arguments, identity, logging, rate limits, stop conditions, rollback, and recovery from partial failure. Start with assistance when the task is unfamiliar, evidence is incomplete, or errors are expensive. Consider limited automation only after representative evaluation shows dependable behavior and the complete system can observe, contain, and reverse actions. Some tasks should remain unautomated because the evidence is insufficient, affected people need meaningful review or appeal, or the harm cannot be acceptably bounded.

## Checkpoint: Authority Checkpoint

Checkpoint. A system drafts an account-suspension recommendation from supplied evidence, but an authorized person must inspect the evidence and approve any change. Is this assistance or full automation? Name the feature that determines your answer, and identify one control that would still be required.

Expected learner action: Classify the workflow as assistance because a person retains action authority, then name a control such as evidence access, audit logging, authorization, or appeal.

- <https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework>

## Pause: Authority Response Time

## Feedback: Authority Feedback

A strong answer calls this assistance because an authorized person retains the decision and action. That does not make the system risk free. The reviewer needs the underlying evidence, not only the model recommendation. Access must be limited, the decision should be auditable, affected people may need a correction or appeal path, and the system must not quietly change the record before approval. If you called it automation only because software produced the recommendation, revise your rule: classify the workflow by who has authority to act and whether meaningful review occurs before the consequence.

Correct feedback: You classified the workflow by action authority and preserved controls around evidence, authorization, audit, and correction.

Retry feedback: Revise the answer by identifying who can perform the consequential action and whether review happens before it.

## Narration: Human Accountability Explanation

Human accountability does not disappear when an AI output is accurate. People and organizations choose the purpose, acceptable risk, data, model, tools, evaluation method, deployment boundary, and response to harm. A model cannot accept responsibility, hear an appeal, authorize a policy exception, or repair an injured relationship. High-impact uses therefore need named owners, documented review criteria, accessible correction or appeal paths, and evidence that performance is acceptable for the people and situations affected. Accountability also means knowing when not to proceed. If representative evidence is missing, privacy expectations cannot be met, the system cannot be stopped safely, or no one can own recovery, the responsible release mode may be no AI or a narrowly bounded experiment. The goal is not to maximize automation. The goal is to achieve a worthwhile outcome while keeping authority, evidence, and consequences visible to the people responsible for them.

## Demonstration: Use Case Triage Demonstration

Watch the triage method on two tasks. Task one is drafting three event descriptions from approved facts for an organizer to edit. The outcome is bounded, the input is known, the draft is reversible, and review happens before publication. A sensible first release is assistance with factual and style checks. Task two is automatically denying a person access to an essential service based on incomplete notes. The consequence is high, the evidence is weak, affected people need explanation and appeal, and the proposed action may violate policy or law. The correct first release is not automation. It may be no AI, or a carefully governed decision-support experiment that cannot perform the denial. For each task, write a verification method and a stop condition. This keeps the release decision connected to evidence rather than enthusiasm.

## Narration: Worked Case Dossier Narration

Introduce the dossier as a completed example. The library system creates a private announcement draft from a supplied brief, and the librarian checks every factual field before publication. The food-pantry system suggests a slot or missing field, but staff review every suggestion and the system cannot deny service or contact an applicant. The pothole system ranks reports for inspection, while an inspector retains approval authority for dispatch. The greenhouse system proposes an irrigation schedule, but a worker reviews it and can use a manual procedure. Notice that the cases do not need one of each mode. The modes follow evidence, permissions, reversibility, and consequences. A ranking method does not automatically justify automation, and a useful draft does not automatically justify publication.

## Narration: Worked Case Trace Narration

Trace the food-pantry case slowly. The scan and appointment data are inputs. Extraction and classification are model capabilities. The application places a suggestion in a staff queue. That queue, its permissions, review procedure, and logs are part of the complete system. A suggestion is not a fact and is not a decision. Staff compare it with the original form, correct it, and decide what happens next. The pantry organization remains accountable. NIST's AI Risk Management Framework describes AI systems as sociotechnical systems, so judge data, tools, people, controls, and the model together. NIST's Generative AI Profile is a risk-management companion, not a capability catalog. Sources are https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AI.100-1 and https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AI.600-1. Ask learners to notice the boundary between proposing a result and taking action. Here the system may propose a staff task, but it may not deny service, alter the applicant record, or send a message. A correction and appeal path make accountability usable.

## Learner Prompt: Worked Case Trace Prompt

Practice pause: point to the exact step where the model produces an output, the step where the application presents it, and the step where an accountable person makes the decision. Then name one correction the applicant could request.

## Narration: Onramp Exercise Narration

Now pause for the supplied onramp. Do not choose your own tasks yet. Use the food-pantry case and write one offline record. Include a concrete objective, the actual scan and appointment artifacts, a capability, affected people, consequence of error, permissions, reversibility, monitoring, release mode, verification, stop condition, owner, and correction or appeal path. Choose no AI if that is the most justified baseline. Otherwise justify the selected mode from the case facts. This is a conceptual exercise. No Python, deployment lab, or runnable code is needed. The purpose is to practice reasoning about a complete system.

## Learner Prompt: Onramp Exercise Prompt

Practice pause: complete the food-pantry record now. Before continuing, check that your stop condition is observable, your verification names what staff compare, and your release mode reflects what the system is actually permitted to do.

## Narration: Changed Input Case Narration

Next, work independently on the changed school-maintenance case before reading the key. The system receives a photograph, room number, equipment ID, and description. It may propose a hazard flag, category, and work-order draft, but it cannot declare a room safe, close a work order, or send a final message. The important facts are the physical consequence of a missed hazard, the supervisor's approval, the ability to correct a draft, and incomplete evidence from blurry photographs, missing IDs, and unevaluated lighting conditions. Write the release mode, verification, stop condition, owner, and remedy. Do not choose an answer merely because the model sounds confident. No AI remains available if the district does not find a demonstrated benefit or cannot justify safe review and data handling.

## Learner Prompt: Changed Input Case Prompt

Practice pause: make your independent choice before opening the hints or key. Explain what the system may do, what it may not do, what evidence would cause a manual handoff, and why no AI might or might not be the best baseline.

Expected learner action: Practice pause: make your independent choice before opening the hints or key. Explain what the system may do, what it may not do, what evidence would cause a manual handoff, and why no AI might or might not be the best baseline.

## Pause: Changed Input Case Pause

## Narration: Changed Input Hints Narration

Offer the hints one at a time. First, distinguish a possible hazard flag from a declaration that a room is safe. Second, treat a blurry image or missing identifier as incomplete evidence, not as permission to guess. Third, name the maintenance supervisor as accountable owner and provide a way to correct the location, identity, hazard label, or status. Fourth, keep the permission boundary at a separate proposed work order and require physical inspection before final action. These hints support reasoning, but they do not force adoption of AI. A manual route can be the right answer when the expected benefit has not been demonstrated.

- <https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework>

## Narration: Changed Input Key Narration

Give the worked key only after the independent attempt. Assistance with review is justified by the case as written: the supervisor inspects the item and approves the final work order. Automation with monitoring is not justified because a missed hazard can injure someone and the evidence is incomplete. Verification compares the image, room, identifier, and description with the physical item. The stop condition routes cases to manual handling when the image is blurry, the location is uncertain, fields conflict, or inspection shows unreliable categorization. No AI is also valid if the district finds no demonstrated benefit, prefers a manual baseline, or cannot provide justified review and data controls. Limited automation could become valid after documented evaluation, approval gates, and safe handling of incomplete inputs. The answer is conditional reasoning, not memorizing a mode.

## Narration: Triage Rubric Narration

Close with the rubric. A strong record has a specific outcome, fitting capability, actual inputs or artifacts, affected people, consequence, release mode, permissions, reversibility, monitoring, verification, stop or rollback condition, accountable owner, and remedy. Weak records say accurate without naming a test, call the model the whole system, give automation no permission boundary, or mention human involvement without naming what the person checks. Now choose four tasks from your own context. Consider text, vision, audio, ranking, recommendation, forecasting, or pattern detection. Provider names do not establish current features, ranking, price, or benefit. For every task, compare AI with a manual or no-AI baseline and adopt AI only when the complete system has a demonstrated, justified benefit.

## Learner Prompt: Triage Rubric Prompt

Practice pause: for each of your four tasks, underline the consequence, circle the accountable owner, and draw an arrow from the verification step to the stop or rollback condition. Then write one sentence explaining why your selected mode is better justified than no AI, or why no AI is the appropriate baseline.

Expected learner action: Practice pause: for each of your four tasks, underline the consequence, circle the accountable owner, and draw an arrow from the verification step to the stop or rollback condition. Then write one sentence explaining why your selected mode is better justified than no AI, or why no AI is the appropriate baseline.

## Pause: Triage Rubric Pause

## Transition: Activity Transition

Now complete the use-case triage activity with four tasks from work, school, home, or a community setting. For each one, name the outcome, input data, capability pattern, affected people, and consequence of error. Choose no AI, reviewed assistance, approval-gated action, or monitored automation. Add one verification method and one stop or rollback condition. Your strongest submission will explain why the highest-risk row receives the strongest human control. You may use the transcript and the static system map while you work.

## Pause: Activity Work Time

## Assessment Handoff: Assessment Handoff

When you are ready, begin the knowledge check. You will identify the parts of a complete AI system, choose a strong starting task, distinguish assistance from automation, preserve human accountability, and use outcome, data, affected people, consequences, and verification to evaluate a use case. Review any section or the text-only class before submitting. The assessment opens only when you choose Begin knowledge check.

## Closing: Class Closing

Keep one sentence: judge the complete system, not the impressive response. Match authority and controls to the consequence of being wrong, and keep an accountable person able to review, stop, correct, and recover.
